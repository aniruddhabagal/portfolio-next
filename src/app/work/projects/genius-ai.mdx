## Genius AI Platform

Genius is a comprehensive AI SaaS platform that I built with modern technologies. It offers multiple AI generation capabilities including:

- Conversation (ChatGPT-like functionality)
- Image generation
- Video generation
- Music generation
- Code generation

### Key Features

- **Multi-modal AI generation**: Text, image, video, music, and code
- **User authentication**: Secure login with credentials
- **Stripe integration**: Subscription-based pricing model
- **Free tier limitations**: Reasonable usage limits for free users
- **Premium subscriptions**: Expanded capabilities for paying customers

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, Tailwind CSS, ShadcN UI
- **Backend**: Node.js with Next.js API routes
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: Clerk Auth
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **AI APIs**: OpenAI, Replicate
- **Deployment**: Vercel

### Challenges & Solutions

One of the main challenges was implementing a reliable rate limiting system that would track usage across different AI services while maintaining good performance. I solved this by creating a centralized middleware that efficiently tracked API calls and user quotas.

### Results

The platform has attracted over 1,000 users in its first month, with a 5% conversion rate to paid subscriptions. Users have generated over 50,000 AI outputs across all modalities.
