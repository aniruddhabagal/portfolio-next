### Challenges & Solutions

The biggest challenge was implementing seamless audio playback that would continue even as users navigated between pages. I solved this by creating a global audio player context that persisted across page navigation in the Next.js app.

### Results

This project helped me deeply understand state management in React, working with audio APIs, and integrating third-party services. It demonstrates my ability to build complex, interactive web applications with modern technologies.
