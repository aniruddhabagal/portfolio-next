### Challenges & Solutions

One significant challenge was implementing real-time inventory updates across multiple concurrent sessions. I solved this by implementing a pub/sub system with WebSockets to ensure all clients receive immediate inventory updates.

Another challenge was optimizing image loading for product galleries. I implemented a lazy-loading strategy with responsive images and WebP format conversion to significantly improve page load times.

### Results

The platform achieved a 35% improvement in conversion rates compared to the client's previous solution, with a 60% reduction in cart abandonment. The admin dashboard reduced inventory management time by approximately 70%.
